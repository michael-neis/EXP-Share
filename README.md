# EXP Share

EXP Share was built to function as a hybrid video game review and social media site. As a user, you are able to leave reviews on games you've played, create public and private lists of games, and get auto-generated suggestions from an algorithm based on your highest reviewed games. You are also able to add friends, message them, view their public lists and reviews, and suggest games for them to try out.
